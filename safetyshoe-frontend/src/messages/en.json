    "label": "Our Story",
    "title": "From Humble Beginnings to Global Manufacturer",
    "p1": "It started in 1995 with a simple vision: to make a pair of safety shoes that were actually comfortable and durable for local workers. Our founder, Mr. Li, realized that while safety shoes on the market were tough, they were often heavy and painful to wear. He began his quest in a small workshop in Gaomi with just one vintage sewing machine.",
    "p2": "Thirty years later, while our factory has expanded to 6 automated Desma lines and over 300 skilled craftsmen, that original intention has never changed. We aren't just making shoes; we are protecting the feet of workers laboring in extreme environments.",
    "quote": "Safety is not a luxury, but a fundamental right for every worker. Our job is to ensure their feet are as comfortable as when they started, even after a long shift.",
    "p3": "Today, our safety shoes are exported to over 50 countries worldwide. From the scorching mines of Australia to the icy construction sites of Northern Europe, you can find our products. We combine traditional shoemaking craftsmanship with modern material technology to continuously redefine industrial protection standards.",
